                <div className="mb-[5px]"> Hey Creators,</div>
                YT Shops started with a simple idea - a place where creators like
                you can find everything you need without paying a dime, saving their
                time, effort and money. We&apos;ve always been here to make sure you
                have the best tools and resources at your fingertips for free. To
                keep this dream alive and kicking, we&apos;re reaching out for a
                little support from you, our creative family.

                <div className="font-semibold">Sustain the Ecosystem</div>
                Your donations are the lifeblood that keeps our services up and
                running. They help cover the operational costs like server
                maintenance, which are substantial given the vast amount of content
                we host.

                <div className="font-semibold">Reward Contributors</div>
                While we offer a platform for content creators to share their
                assets, we believe in giving back to them for their generosity. Your
                contributions help us support these creative minds who fuel YT
                Shops.

                revolutionize content creation. Financial contributions accelerate
                our development efforts, bringing these tools to you faster.
